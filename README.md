This script utilizes the Requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL (https://filesamples.com/samples/audio/mp3/Symphony%20No.6%20(1st%20movement).mp3). It then saves the content of the response as an audio file (download.mp3) in the project folder.

Install dependencies:

``pip install requests``

Run the script:

``python audio_file_downloader.py``

Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to access the specified URL and save files locally. Adjust the URL and output filename (download.mp3) as needed if you want to download a different audio file or save it with a different name.
